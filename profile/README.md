# The Agon Platform organisation

Welcome to the AgonPlatform organisation on GitHub.

This organisation is the home to firmware and various other tools for the range of Agon platform computers.  If you have an Agon Light, an Olimex Agon Light 2, an Agon Light Origins Edition, or an Agon Console8 you have come to the right place.
